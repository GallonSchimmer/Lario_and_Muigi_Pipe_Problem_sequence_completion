# Lario and Muigi Pipe Problem

## Problem Statement
Ensure a sequence of numbers is complete without any gaps. Given a sorted list of unique numbers, return a new list where missing numbers in the sequence are filled in.

## Examples
- Input:  [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
  Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
- Input:  [6, 9]
  Output: [6, 7, 8, 9]

## Solution Concept
This problem demonstrates the use of sequence generation and gap identification, which are fundamental for:
- Data preprocessing.
- Ensuring integrity of sequenced data.

The solution iterates over the list, checks for sequence continuity, and fills any gaps detected.
